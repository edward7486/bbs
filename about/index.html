<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>Bed Bug Survivors is a site dedicated to highlighting the human experience of dealing with bed bug infestations. We share stories with the aim of spreading knowledge about bed bugs with all of our readers.</p>

<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p>I had a bed bug infestation back in 2011. It shook my world; I was a recent college graduate living in a tiny studio. Little did I know buying a used futon from Craigslist would make my life a living hell for months on end. I relate to every person whose dealt with or currently dealing with bed bugs. This site is my way of fighting against them over a decade later by hopefully sharing and passing along knowledge from others so we can all be more prepared for bed bugs.</p>

<h2 id="survivors-really">“Survivors”, really?</h2>

<p>If you’ve ever had bed bugs, you know just how hellish that experience is. Never being able to have that good night’s rest knowing they’re going to be sucking your blood and giving you more bites. Not even a day nap feels comfortable. Bed bugs destroy your quality of life. Those of us who have ever had to deal with bed bugs I absolutely commend you as a survivor.</p>
